              <p>
                HEARTS was based on our inspiration and our wanting to inspire others. We were inspired to help others when we noticed real world problems around us and wanted to help others through what we know; one such example includes our use of
                our background in arts. This is the foundation of our nonprofit organization. We feed our own ambition into our passion to inspire others—through our dance. By partnering with local charities, we have choreographed and presented our
                dance skills on stage.

              <h6>Creativity</h6>
              <p>
                Creativity is crucial to HEARTS' mission. We reach out to people in our community and motivate individuals to express themselves and help other people. Arts and creativity are crucial part of every person’s life. Humans have always
                used art to communicate and express themselves, sometimes making tremendous discoveries about their inner self and humanity while doing so. We want people to experience the happiness and sense of peace that comes from art, and the
                sense of serenity it leaves you with.

              <h6>Collaboration</h6>
              <p>
                Our core principles state that in order for everyone to be happy and express themselves through arts we all need to be unified and work together. We all must accept each other cherish the different contributions that each unique
                person gives to our community. Art is something that everyone should have access to and that everyone should be able to do. In order for this to happen, we all have to work together, and make everyone feel like who they are is
                enough, and that their art is valued and will make a difference.

          <p class="lead pt-4">HEARTS was founded to connect and support individuals in society to raise awareness for real world problems. Seven young individuals came together with a drive to support others and use their skills to reach out into
            their communities. We have supported various charities and drawn attention to issues in our society and we plan to create a legacy and set example for all who follow. We are determined to support what we believe in forever, and help
            those who need help. </p>

          <p class="lead pt-4">Our logo represents the symbol of happiness: the most important aspect of our non-profit organization. This is the symbol of a bluebird, as the harbinger of happiness is found in many cultures and may date back
            thousands of years. It represents our perseverance and inspiration as part of this non-profit. Our use of the colors lavender and coral represent creativity, uniqueness, and harmony. </p>
