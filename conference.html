      <p>Helping Everyone Via Arts, HEARTS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, was founded to motivate individuals in society to raise awareness for real-world problems. With a drive to support others through the utilization of our artful skills, we have
        subsidized various charities and inspirited people to express themselves by spreading our love for the arts. We encompass many interests from coding to drama and dance in our workshops.
        <br><br>
        With this conference, our goal is to show individuals that a passion for art does not hinder a practical future. We are focusing on innovators in the professional field who use art in their daily lives and jobs. Our speakers discuss
        scientific exploration such as robotics and the importance of arts in early adolescence. They show us that art can enrich your life and career. We invite you to attend this two-day conference and expand your horizons.

          <p class="indent" id="hide1" style="display:none;font-size:12px;">The focal point of my presentation is about advocating for art and diversity in an early education setting. Children are special and deserve the appropriate care and
            attention that would enable them to reach their full potential. Children naturally need art to learn and to explore. Art is a medium for all aspects of learning and it is a natural need. The arts enable the achievement of unlimited aims
            and create ideas, and offer a wide array of entertainments. Furthermore, The arts shape personalities, develop positive attitudes, and distinguishing characteristics. Art education also helps in improving reasoning, intuition,
            imagination, and enhance intellectual skills.</p>

            journey of how she took an unconventional path from her finance BComm degree to social-tech entrepreneurship at FLIK. In her day-to-day life as the Marketing Manager at FLIK, a freelancer, and an Instagram micro-influencer, Kiersay has

          <div style="clear: both;"></div>
          <p class="indent" id="hide4" style="display:none;font-size:12px;">Art is embedded in Native American culture through all aspects of our lives. Through the creation and continuation of song, dance, beadwork, weaving and many other forms of
            art, our traditional cultures continue to thrive in a world that attempted to not only strip away all parts of our culture from our people, but to erase us completely. Through this presentation, you will learn about various Native
            American cultural arts, our use of art through activism, and the harm caused by the (mis)appropriation of our arts and culture.</p>

          <p class="indent" id="hide5" style="display:none;font-size:12px;">Art and science have long been intertwined. As these disciplines have become increasingly specialized, however, popular and professional conceptions of the relationship
            between art and science have become siloed, separated. In this talk, we will explore how technology and cultural influences have impacted the way that art and science interact and the influence this has on how scientists share their
            science.</p>

          <p class="indent" id="hide10" style="display:none;font-size:12px;">Breaking stereotypes of what engineering can be applied to is a way to broaden the participation into engineering fields. Art allows agency over the manifestation of their
            project which can result in people feeling “allowed” to play in this engineering space that has traditionally been dominated by a narrow identity of people. The robotic dress is an example of breaking these stereotypes.</p>

                  After receiving the exemplary employee award at UC San Diego and the Athena Pinnacle award and invited to do a TEDx talk, she was recruited by Qualcomm to create a similar program named – Thinkabit Lab. Upon leaving Qualcomm,
                  Thinkabit Lab engaged 14,000+ middle school students and has been replicated in many different environments from libraries and schools to universities and companies. Saura was also a contestant on SyFy’s Robot Combat League, was an

                  create, a robotic dress that hugs people. Saura is leading efforts to broaden participation in Data Science by designing creative ways to engage a diverse population.
